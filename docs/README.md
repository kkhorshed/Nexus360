## Recent Changes
- Removed the platform login page (`Login.tsx`) from `frontend/src/routes/`.
- Removed the authentication context (`AuthContext.tsx`) from `frontend/src/contexts/`.
- Updated `frontend/src/main.tsx` to remove the `AuthProvider` wrapper and its import.
- Deleted the `platform/auth` directory, which contained configuration and metadata files related to the authentication service.

## Overview
This project no longer includes a login page or authentication service. Any references to authentication have been removed to streamline the platform.
